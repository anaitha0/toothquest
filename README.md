   The AI dynamically generates new questions using large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on dental knowledge.  

3. **Adaptive Feedback:**  
   When you make a mistake, the system explains the correct answer and gives follow-up questions to reinforce learning.  

4. **Progress Tracking:**  
   Your results are stored and analyzed to guide your learning path automatically.
